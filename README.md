# LC-3 Assembler

This project is an assembler written in C for [Little Computer 3 (LC-3)]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Computer_3))

Here's the list of resources taken as reference for the implementation

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Computer_3)

- [GUI simulator](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~milom/cse240-Fall05/handouts/lc3guide.html)

- [simulator (Virtual Machine) implementation](https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/)

- [learning resources](https://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0072467509/student_view0/index.html)

## Build

To build the project and run the tests, either one of the following options can be used:

- VSCode tasks

- Makefile

VSCode tasks are specially useful to debug the application.


For details about the different compilation flags, see the [GNU docs](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-10.1.0/gcc/Invoking-GCC.html#Invoking-GCC). 

Here's a brief description of some of the flags used in this project.

#### -fno-common

Used to disable [common symbols generation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66044467/why-does-global-variable-definition-in-c-header-file-work).

The justification to use this flag is to enforce good practices when defining global variables, namely: define them in exactly one .c file, then declare them as an extern in a header file which then gets included in the required .c files

## Unit tests

Unit tests are executed with the command:

`make unittest`

After running the unit tests, a browser window will open with the test coverage information, that is the final product of using [gcov](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-10.1.0/gcc/Gcov-Intro.html#Gcov-Intro) and [lcov](http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php). See next section for more details.

### Test coverage

Test coverage is done with [gcov](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-10.1.0/gcc/Gcov-Intro.html#Gcov-Intro), that takes as input two files, [.gcda and .gcno](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-10.1.0/gcc/Gcov-Data-Files.html#Gcov-Data-Files), which are generated thanks to the compilation flags `-fprofile-arcs` and `-ftest-coverage option`, respectively.

The output of gcov is  *.gcov files containing the profiling information in a human-readable format. That information can be better displayed with a graphical tool like [lcov](http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php)

__Note__: in MacOS, lcov can be installed with `brew install lcov`


## Acceptance tests

Acceptance tests are run using a test oracle to compare the oracle predictions to the results of the application.

The oracle is the assembler utility included in:

```
wget https://acg.cis.upenn.edu/milom/cse240-Fall05/handouts/code/LC3sim.jar                                                            
```

`LC3sim.jar` is also a runtime environment to execute the binary code generated by
the assembler.

To execute `LC3sim.jar`, run

```
java -jar LC3sim.jar &
```

## Application

`make myfile CPPFLAGS=-DFAB_MAIN`



## Support tools

The folder `tools` contains some utilities to aid with the development of this assembler:

* `lc3objdump` is a version of [objdump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objdump) to print the binary content of an object file generated by the LC3 assembler; Makefile shows how to run it

__STDC_VERSION__
macro whose value indicates which standard is supported by the compiler
